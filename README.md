### Recommend Updating Version
Please, file an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/build2-packaging/happly/issues) with the new recommended version.

### Update Version by Pull Request
1. Fork the repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/build2-packaging/happly) and clone it to your local machine.
2. Run `git submodule init` and `git submodule update` to get the current upstream directory.
3. Inside the `upstream` directory, checkout the new library version `X.Y.Z` by calling `git checkout vX.Y.Z` that you want to be packaged.
4. If needed, change source files, `buildfiles`, and symbolic links accordingly to create a working build2 package. Make sure not to directly depend on the upstream directory inside the build system but use symbolic links instead.
5. Update library version in `manifest` file if it has changed or add package update by using `+n` for the `n`-th update.
6. Make an appropriate commit message by using imperative mood and a capital letter at the start and push the new commit to the `master` branch.
7. Run `bdep ci` and test for errors.
8. If everything works fine, make a pull request on GitHub and write down the `bdep ci` link to your CI tests.
9. After a successful pull request, we will run the appropriate commands to publish a new package version.
